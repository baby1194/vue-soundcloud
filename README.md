## NOTE:
It seems that SoundCloud has revoked my api client keys without any explanation or warning. Running the app locally no longer works unless you have a working SoundCloud API client id (SoundCloud has disabled registration of new apps for quite some time now). The [live demo](https://vue-soundcloud.herokuapp.com) is also not working at the moment.
